# LambdaBlueprints
Blueprints for AWS Lambda in Java

- AWS Lambda provides blueprints for various aws resources that can be used in AWS Lambda. However for Java, there are no blueprints.
- This project aims to develop various blueprints to ease the development of AWS Lambda applications in Java.
- To ensure the code is testable, the development will ensure unit test coverage > 90% and functional testing of each lambda before being pushed to main branch.
